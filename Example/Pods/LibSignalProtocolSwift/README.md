# LibSignalProtocolSwift
A Swift implementation of the Signal Protocol. The [Signal Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol)
can be used for secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging in synchronous and asynchronous environments. It has
many desirable cryptographic features and can handle missing and out-of-order messages. The Signal protocol
is used by the [Signal Messenger](https://signal.org) as well as WhatsApp, Facebook, Skype and others. Additional
information can be found [here](https://signal.org/docs/).

## Purpose

This Swift library is intended for educational purposes only, in order to show the way the Signal Protocol works.
It somewhat mimics the functionality and structure of the [Signal Protocol C implementation](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-c).

## Installation

You can install `LibSignalProtocolSwift` through [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org), by adding the following to your `Podfile`:

````ruby
pod 'LibSignalProtocolSwift', '~> 1.3'
````

After installation the Framework can be accessed by importing it:

```swift
import SignalProtocol
```

## Prerequisites

### Local storage
The Signal Protocol needs local storage for message keys, identities and other state information.
You can provide this functionality by implementing the protocol `KeyStore`, which requires
four delegates for the individual data stores:

- `IdentityKeyStore` for storing and retrieving identity keys
- `PreKeyStore` for storing and retrieving pre keys
- `SessionStore` for storing and retrieving the sessions
- `SignedPreKeyStore` for storing and retrieving signed pre keys

#### Optional
There is a feature for group updates, where only one administrator can send, and the others can only receive. If you want this functionality, then implement the `GroupKeyStore` protocol, with the additional delegate  `SenderKeyStore` for storing and retrieving sender keys.

### Sample implementation

You can have a look at the [test implementation](https://github.com/christophhagen/LibSignalProtocolSwift/tree/master/Tests/Test%20Implementation) for inspiration.

### Server for message delivery
The server that stores the messages for retrieval needs to store the following data for each `SignalAddress`:
- `Public Identity Key`: The public part of the identity key of the device
- `Signed Pre Key`: The current signed pre key
- `Pre Keys`: A number of unsigned pre keys
- `Messages`: The messages to deliver to that address, including the sender

## Usage

The standard process to establish an encrypted session between two devices (two distinct `SignalAddress`es) is usually as follows:

- Alice uploads her `Identity`  and a `SignedPreKey` to the server, as well as a number of unsigned `PreKey`s.
- Bob retrieves a `PreKeyBundle` from the server, consisting of Alice's `Identity`, the `SignedPreKey`, and one of the `PreKey`s (which is then deleted from the server).
- Bob creates a session by processing the `PreKeyBundle` and encrypting a `PreKeyMessage` which he uploads to the server.
- Alice receives Bob's `PreKeyMessage` from the server and decryptes the message.
- The encrypted session is established for both Alice and Bob.

### Creating identity and keys

Before any secure communication can happen, at least one user needs to upload all necessary ingredients for a `PreKeyBundle` to the server.

````swift
// Create the identity key ata install time
let identity = try SignalCrypto.generateIdentityKeyPair()

// Store the data in the key store

// Get the public key from the store
let publicKey: Data = try bobStore.getPublicIdentityKey()

// Create pre keys and save them in the store
let preKeys: [Data] = try bobStore.createPreKeys(count: 10)

// Create a signed pre key and save it in the store
let signedPreKey: Data = try bobStore.updateSignedPrekey()

// Upload publicKey, preKeys, and signedPreKey to the server
````

### Creating a session from a PreKeyBundle

Let's assume that Alice (who has the `SignalAddress` aliceAddress) wants to establish a session with Bob (`SignalAddress` bobAddress)

````swift
// Download Bob's identity, current signedPreKey and one of the preKeys from the server

// Create PreKeyBundle
let preKeyBundle = try SessionPreKeyBundle(
    preKey: preKey,
    signedPreKey: signedPreKey,
    identityKey: identity)

// Create a new session by processing the PreKeyBundle
let session = SessionCipher(store: aliceStore, remoteAddress: bobAddress)
try session.process(preKeyBundle: preKeyBundle)

// The message to encrypt
let message = "Hello Bob, it's Alice".data(using: .utf8)!

// Here Alice can send messages to Bob
let encryptedMessage = try session.encrypt(message)

// Upload the message to the server
````

### Creating a session from a received PreKeySignalMessage
Let's continue the above example and assume Bob receives the message from Alice. Bob can then establish the session:

````swift
// Get the message from the server

// Create the session
let session = SessionCipher(store: bobStore, remoteAddress: aliceAddress)

// Process the message
let decryptedMessage = try session.decrypt(preKeyMessage)
````

### Using an already established session
Now Alice and Bob can both send and receive messages at will.

#### Sending

```swift
// Compose a message
let message =  "Hello there".data(using: .utf8)!

// Send message to Bob
let session = SessionCipher(store: aliceStore, remoteAddress: bobAddress)

// Encrypt
let encryptedMessage = try session.encrypt(message)
```

#### Receiving

```swift
// Get message from the server

// Receive message from Alice
let session = SessionCipher(store: bobStore, remoteAddress: aliceAddress)

// Decrypt
let decryptedMessage = try session.decrypt(message)
```

#### Verifying identity Keys

To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks it can be beneficial to compare the identity keys either
by manually comparing the fingerprints or through scanning some sort of code (e.g. a QR-Code).
The library provides a convenient way for this:

```swift
// Create the fingerprint
let aliceFP = try aliceStore.fingerprint(for: bobAddress, localAddress: aliceAddress)

// Display the string...
let display = fingerprint.displayText

// ... or transmit the scannable data to the other client...
let scanData = try fingerprint.scannable.protoData()

// ... or compare to a received fingerprint
fingerprint.matches(scannedFingerprint)
```

### Miscellaneous

#### Client identifiers
The library is designed to allow different identifiers to distinguish between the different users.
The test implementation uses the `SignalAddress` struct for this, which consists of a `String` (e.g. a phone number)
and an `Int`, the `deviceId`. However it is possible to use different structs, classes, or types, as long as they
conform to the `Hashable`, `Equatable` and `CustomStringConvertible` protocols. For example, simple strings can be used:

```swift
class MyCustomKeyStore: KeyStore {

    typealias Address = String

    ...
}
```

Now, SessionCipher can be instantiated, using `MyCustomKeyStore` :

```swift
let aliceStore = MyCustomKeyStore()
let session = SessionCipher(store: aliceStore, remoteAddress: "Bob")
```

#### Providing a custom crypto implementation

It is possible for any custom implementation of the `SignalCryptoProvider` protocol
to serve as the cryptographic backbone of the protocol. This can be done by
setting the static `provider` variable of the `SignalCrypto` class:

```swift
SignalCrypto.provider = MyCustomCryptoProvider()
```

The elliptic curve functions are handled by the same C code that is deployed in
[libsignal-protocol-c](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-c)
and which is packaged in the [Curve25519](https://github.com/christophhagen/Curve25519)
framework to make the functions available in Swift.

#### Documentation

The project is documented heavily because it helps other people understand the code. The [documentation](https://github.com/christophhagen/SignalProtocolSwift/tree/master/Documentation)
is created with [jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy), which creates awesome, apple-like
docs.

The docs can be (re-)generated by running the following in the project directory:
```
jazzy --min-acl private -a 'Christoph Hagen' -u 'https://github.com/christophhagen' -g 'https://github.com/christophhagen/LibSignalProtocolSwift' -e 'Sources/ProtocolBuffers/*' -o 'Documentation'
```
